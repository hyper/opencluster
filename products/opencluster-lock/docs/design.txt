BRIEF OVERVIEW

This product is intended to be standalone cluster locking service.  It will allow a lock to be set, and released.  There is nothing stopping an application from ignoring the lock, so it is up to the application to follow the rules.




PRIMARY REQUIREMENTS

1. Security - access should be protected by certificates.  communications should be encrypted.  Stored data should be encrypted.
2. Highly Available
3. Scalable
4. Avoid, or allow to manage, a split-brain scenario.
5. Namespaces - should allow for different namespaces or tenents.  There should be no ability for tenents or namespaces to pollute or even be aware of each other.
6. Locks should be given a name.
7. Only the service that requested the lock, can release it.





EXISTING COMPETING PRODUCTS

I am unaware of any existing product that provides a standalone cluster lock service.  However, many clustered data services also provide locking mechanisms, although a lot of these are not specifically locking services, but rather the ability to simulate a 
locking service using the clustered data service.
