The tools that would be used to interact with the conninfo files would be.
Most of these would be useful for scripting.  Particularly the automatic generation of conninfo files, or pulling info out.

set
	Will update the conninfo file with specific information, most likely the IP address that is embedded in the file.
	eg.  conninfo_set node-A10.ci "IP" "127.0.0.1" 

get
	used to extract particular items from the file.  Pulls out specific information.
	eg.  conninfo_get node-A10.ci "Name"

pack
	used to pack the conninfo file the same way that the server does before distributing.  
	This would be useful to take a user generated and formatted file, and generated a more compact version to be given to the client apps.
	eg.  conninfo_pack node-A10.ci.txt > node-A10.ci.packed

public
	Used to generate a public conninfo file based on a private conninfo file.
	Server nodes will have a conninfo file that has private information in it, such as private keys, etc.   
	A public version is needed which has all the private details removed out.  
	The public file can then be given to clients that connect to the nodes.
	eg.  conninfo_public node-A10.ci.private > node-A10.ci
