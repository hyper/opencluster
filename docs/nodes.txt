When a node is started and given the connection info of another node, it will attempt to connect to the other node.

This will involve several phases where it connects to a socket, and authenticates.

When a node is started up, and given multiple nodes to try and connect to.

It will try one at a time until it manages to connect and authenticate.  It will no longer try those 
initial nodes, but will instead try and build a hashmap, and get the node details from there.




Once connected, it will need to get a full hashmap picture.  We can do this in several ways.  It can 
go through the list of hashmaps and fill out any blanks before it considers itself complete.    

Or, it can be more passive and wait until a request comes in, and it discovers that it doesn't know 
where that bucket is, so it asks another node if it knows.  This might be the better option.
