The C library, called libcluster will have two primary modes; Lite, and Full.

The lite mode is a bit easier to use and requires less framework, although there are a few things that the developer 
will need to be aware of for a long-running system.  The Lite version will not use threads, nor handle communications in 
the background.  This means that unsolicited messages from the server will not be processed automaticaly, but will be 
received when other outgoing commands are being sent, and also when it is told to check for new messages.  The lite 
version has access to all the features, but their usability is a little diminished because there is no immediate 
callbacks fired.

The full version requires a little more effort to use, but provides a full experience and should be faster.  It utilises 
threads, and an event system for network activity.  It runs mostly in a seperate thread, and handles the received data 
from the server instantly.
