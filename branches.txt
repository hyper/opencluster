This file provides some information about active branches in the repository.

backup-push
	The nodes in the cluster are supposed to push changes to the backup nodes.  
	Make sure this is working.

serverinfo
	When new nodes connect to existing servers, they need to let their connected clients know about it.

shutdown
	Better handling of the system shutdown.  When a Ctrl-C signal is received it should fire up 
	events to shutdown all the components, mark a variable that the stats can monitor.  When the 
	active number of clients and nodes drops to zero, then the stats event will stop also, which 
	should be the last event, and the system should shutdown.  We dont need a particular shutdown 
	event to fire more than once.  Once the shutdown is triggered, everything should start shutting 
	down and manage themselves doing it.  Need to be careful about dropping node connections that we 
	need to send buckets away.

shutdown-migrate
	When a node is being shutdown, it needs to send the buckets to another node.

goodbye
	When a client or node sends the 'goodbye' command, the server needs to send a reply and close 
	the connection properly.  Current tests are showing the client is still staying connected and 
	the goodbye command is not being processed properly because it keeps getting logged, but the 
	client doesn't disconnect.

data-logging
	A special node can connect to the cluster that logs all the updates that occur.  It logs the 
	output to a series of files.  It can also be used to re-inject that logged data into a cluster.

savefile
	when a node is shutting down, it will normally attempt to send the buckets it has to another
	node in the cluster.  If there are no other nodes, the data should instead be saved to a file, 
	that can then be used to inject the data back in when the cluster is restarted.   The file-save 
	option would be present from start, but it will only write to the file if it is the last one in 
	the cluster.   The daemon can inject the data into the cluster on startup.

client-shutdown
	The C client is not shutting down properly when more than one node connection has been 
	established.  This is seen when one node is started, gamut is run, another node is started, wait 
	for migration to complete, another gamut is run.

client-maps
	The C client does not handle maps properly (or at all), so it needs to be able to use maps.

client-disconnect
	The C client is not handling things if it loses the connection to the server.  Now that we have 
	implemented the GOODBYE command, we lose connection to the server when the server closes it.   
	The client needs to be able to mark it as failed, and re-connect when needed.

Reconnecting Nodes
	If a node is known, but it connects, the server is failing because it is adding the node name to 
	the list again.  This is incorrect.  It needs to look at the list to see if the node is already 
	in there.  If it is, it doesnt need to be added again.
