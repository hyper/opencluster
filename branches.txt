THis file provides some information about active branches in the repository.

server-sync
	This branch is to ensure that when nodes are connected to the cluster, they send communications to the backup nodes 
	of any changes to buckets.

system-logging
	Rather than printing to the output stream, we need to log certain info to a logfile that gets renamed when it gets 
	too big.  The log data can be output using an event.

data-logging
	A special node can connect to the cluster that logs all the updates that occur.  It logs the output to a series of 
	files.  It can also be used to re-inject that logged data into a cluster.

split_code
	split the server code into seperate source files because the code is currently getting a little bit large and messy.   
	I prefer to keep it in one file, but admit that it might be better overall to split it up.  Will need to use 'extern' 
	for the global variables.  Will need to ensure dependencies in makefile, which might get tricky for debug/nondebug 
	versions.
