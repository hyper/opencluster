THis file provides some information about active branches in the repository.

server-sync
	This branch is to ensure that when nodes are connected to the cluster, they send communications 
	to the backup nodes of any changes to buckets.

system-logging
	Rather than printing to the output stream, we need to log certain info to a logfile that gets 
	renamed when it gets too big.  The log data can be output using an event.

shutdown
	Better handling of the system shutdown.  When a Ctrl-C signal is received it should fire up 
	events to shutdown all the components, mark a variable that the stats can monitor.  When the 
	active number of clients and nodes drops to zero, then the stats event will stop also, which 
	should be the last event, and the system should shutdown.  We dont need a particular shutdown 
	event to fire more than once.  Once the shutdown is triggered, everything should start shutting 
	down and manage themselves doing it.  Need to be careful about dropping node connections that we 
	need to send buckets away.

data-logging
	A special node can connect to the cluster that logs all the updates that occur.  It logs the 
	output to a series of files.  It can also be used to re-inject that logged data into a cluster.
