This file provides some information about active branches in the repository.

debug-logging
	When running a debug build, it is possible taht it logs information out to the log, but then
	an assert fires, and the data is never written to the log, because it buffers it and sets an 
	event to fire.  When assert happens process exits immediately.  So, when compiling a debug 
	build, it will instead log data to the logfile immediately, rather than setting an event.

verify-cluster
	make sure that the migration is moving the buckets evenly, and that clients are getting the 
	right information.   When a migration is completed, make sure the client is asking the server 
	for the right information.  

	After adding the Stats Dump, I can see that the buckets are not migrating correctly, and various 
	stats are not getting set right.  

	  * after the migrate, the _nobackup_buckets is still 16.
	  * after the migrate, all the buckets on the first node are listed as primary, all on the 
	    second node are secondary.  It should have been half and half.

empty-migrate
	Make sure that the cluster can migrate empty buckets.  There was an issue with this when doing 
	tests, so it should be looked at.  It makes sense that a number of cluster nodes would likely 
	be started before any data is put in them.

serverinfo
	When new nodes connect to existing servers, they need to let their connected clients know about it.

shutdown
	Better handling of the system shutdown.  When a Ctrl-C signal is received it should fire up 
	events to shutdown all the components, mark a variable that the stats can monitor.  When the 
	active number of clients and nodes drops to zero, then the stats event will stop also, which 
	should be the last event, and the system should shutdown.  We dont need a particular shutdown 
	event to fire more than once.  Once the shutdown is triggered, everything should start shutting 
	down and manage themselves doing it.  Need to be careful about dropping node connections that we 
	need to send buckets away.

shutdown-migrate
	When a node is being shutdown, it needs to send the buckets to another node.

data-logging
	A special node can connect to the cluster that logs all the updates that occur.  It logs the 
	output to a series of files.  It can also be used to re-inject that logged data into a cluster.

savefile
	when a node is shutting down, it will normally attempt to send the buckets it has to another
	node in the cluster.  If there are no other nodes, the data should instead be saved to a file, 
	that can then be used to inject the data back in when the cluster is restarted.   The file-save 
	option would be present from start, but it will only write to the file if it is the last one in 
	the cluster.   The daemon can inject the data into the cluster on startup.

client-shutdown
	The C client is not shutting down properly when more than one node connection has been 
	established.  This is seen when one node is started, gamut is run, another node is started, wait 
	for migration to complete, another gamut is run.

client-maps
	The C client does not handle maps properly (or at all), so it needs to be able to use maps.

client-disconnect
	The C client is not handling things if it loses the connection to the server.  Now that we have 
	implemented the GOODBYE command, we lose connection to the server when the server closes it.   
	The client needs to be able to mark it as failed, and re-connect when needed.
