THis file provides some information about active branches in the repository.

loadlevels
	Node repeatedly requests the load levels from connected nodes.   If the loadlevels are not balanced, it triggers a 
	migration.

bucket-migration
	Migrate a bucket from one node to another... updating clients of the change.

node-timeout
	When a node is in the Node-list, but it is not connected, a one minute timer will fire 30 times, if a connection 
	hasn't been established in that time, then the node is removed from the list and will not be attempted again.  To 
	get that node to connect to the cluster, it will have to establish the connection.

server-sync
	This branch is to ensure that when nodes are connected to the cluster, they send communications to the backup nodes 
	of any changes to buckets.

system-logging
	Rather than printing to the output stream, we need to log certain info to a logfile that gets renamed when it gets 
	too big.  The log data can be output using an event.

data-logging
	A special node can connect to the cluster that logs all the updates that occur.  It logs the output to a series of 
	files.  It can also be used to re-inject that logged data into a cluster.
