/* The Query protocol is that clients use to communicate with the server nodes.  So here we will 
 * maintain the list of clients that are communicating, and handle their requests.   Since the 
 * connections will be using the same encryption method as the Sync protocol, the actual code that 
 * handles the socket and encryption data will be handled by 'Connections' objects.
