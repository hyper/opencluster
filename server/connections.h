// connections.h

// This module takes care of communications between the server and some other entity.  Everything here is very generalized, and should make callbacks to the specified function specified to handle particular events.   

// This will be used by both server-node connections, and client connections, but no logic should be specific to either.  Actually, this connection object should have no knowledge of whether it is talking to a client or a server node.
